Alright guys, This is the git repository we're gonna use for the project.
It may be better if we append all out programming update notes to this readme file.

NOTE: Seeing as we are speaking about our updates in this README, commit messages will have the following format:
		commit -a -m "See Update XX-XX-XXXX -My Name"
